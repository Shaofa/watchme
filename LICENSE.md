systrayicon.py - No license info available; I tried contacting the author on 9/5/2013 for license details but haven't heard back yet. The script is about 8 years old, and I see a lot of other folks have included it in their project without licenses so I'm going to move forward with publishing for now and keep trying to reach the author.
